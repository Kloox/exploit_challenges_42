Cookie forgery
In the cookies of the website we had a cookie named i_am_admin which contained a false value in md5
Users can modify cookies and md5 is deprecated because it can be reverse very easily
# How to exploit
---
Using Cookie Quick Manager which is a plugin on Firefox you can get and edit all cookies
Here we get a cookie named i_am_admin with the value ```68934a3e9455fa72420237eb05902327``` which using a reverse md5 gives us ```false ```.
Switching this value to ```B326B5062B2F0E69046810717534CB09``` which is the md5 of ```true``` and we got the following flag : ```df2eb4ba34ed059a1e3e89ff4dfc13445f104a1a52295214def1c4fb1693a5c3```
In a real live case it would have probably give us admin access

# Fix
---
* First do not use a bolean as a value as important as this one
* Ecrypt the value or use a much better hash
