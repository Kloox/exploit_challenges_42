# How to exploit
---
On the page recover password, we inspected the hidden form, identified the webmaster email and switch it by our own. We got the following flag:  ```1D4855F7337C0C14B6F44946872C4EB33853F40B2D54393FBE94F49F1E19BBB0```
# Fix
---
* Don't use hidden form to hide a value but set it in the server.
* Ask mail of user instead of sending only to the webmaster
