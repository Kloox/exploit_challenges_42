# Vulnerability

Htaccess Protect
The file .htpasswd is not protected by htaccess
# How to exploit
---
In the file robots.txt which is in path:```/```  we have seen there is a directory named whatever which contained a file .htpasswd with ```root:8621ffdbc5698829397d97767ac13db3```. By md5 reversing the hash we get the following password: ```dragon```.
After going on ```http://<URL>/admin``` and giving all the above information in the form we received the following flag: ```d19b4823e0d5600ceed56d5e896ef328d7a2b9e7ac7e80f4fcdb9b10bcb3e7ff```
# Fix
---
* Protect his access with the file .htaccess
* Use a stronger password
