# Vulnerability

Unvalidated redirect
Unvalidated redirects are possible when a web application accepts untrusted input that could cause the web application to redirect the request to a URL contained within untrusted input.
# How to exploit
---
We inspect all buttons using a redirection and switch parameter of redirection. Here we switch the URL ```index.php?page=redirect&site=facebook``` to ```index.php?page=redirect&site=admin```. This provided us the following flag: ```b9e775a0291fed784a2d9680fcfad7edd6b8cdf87648da647aaf4bba288bcab3```
# Fix
---
* Don't use redirects
* If you do so don't use URL as user inputs as destination
* If you have to, develop a method to validate a URL
* Or build a redirects map
* Or a waitlist of redirects
