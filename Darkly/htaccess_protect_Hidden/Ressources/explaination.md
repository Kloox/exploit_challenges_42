# Vulnerability

Htaccess Protect
The directory .hidden is not protected by htaccess
# How to exploit
---
In the file robots.txt which is in path:```/```  we have seen there is a directory named .hidden which contained a lot of directory not protect themselves. We downloaded all the directories using :
```bash 
wget --recursive --no-parent -e robots=off -R "index.html" http://<URL>/.hidden/
```
And we read all README.md and try to find the flag using the following command :
```bash
cd .hidden
cat */*/*/README | grep <0-9>
```
We found the following flag: ```99dde1d35d1fdd283924d84e6d9f1d820```
# Fix
---
* Do not hide sensible information in a bunch of files
* If so protect his access with the file .htaccess
