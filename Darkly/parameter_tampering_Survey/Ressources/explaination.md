# How to exploit
---
On the page survey, we switch the value of point we want to give which was supposed to be between 1 and 10 by inspecting the element. (ex: switch 10 to 1000000)
We received the following flag: ```03A944B434D5BAFF05F46C4BEDE5792551A2595574BCAFC9A6E25F67C382CCAA```
# Fix
---
* Verify on the server side that the value is between 1 and 10
