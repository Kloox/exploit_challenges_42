# Vulnerability

Cross-site Scription (XSS)
An attack XSS allows to inject malicious code into forms, viewport etc. This code will be executed by the website. Here the image is loaded by a viewer. The viewer take the parameter given in the URL and set it in the data attribut.
# How to exploit
---
By modifying the parameter src of the URL we give a type of the data we will going to pass. Here we set ```text/html``` and specify that will give the text in base64. So we convert our script ```<script>alert("Hello")</script>``` in base64 ```PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgiSGVsbG8iKTwvc2NyaXB0Pg==```. Finally the URL will be: ```http://<URL>/?page=media&src=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgiSGVsbG8iKTwvc2NyaXB0Pg==``` which originally was ```http://192.168.111.128/?page=media&src=nsa```
This will provide us with the following flag: ```928D819FC19405AE09921A2B71227BD9ABA106F9D2D37AC412E9E5A750F1506D```
# Fix
---
* Do not insert directly data into attribut
* Pass ID that point into images located in database
