Header injection
Modify information in the header which impact how the website behave
# How exploit
---
Following the information provided in the commentary section of the link in the footer we modified the UserAgent and the referer we did change the behavior of the website giving us the following flag: ```f2a29020ef3132e01dd61df97fd33ec8d7fcd1388cc9601e7db691d17d4d6188```
To fake the UserAgent and the referer we used the following command: 
```bash
    curl -A "ft_bornToSec" --referer "https://www.nsa.gov/"  "http://<URL>/?page=e43ad1fdc54babe674da7c7b8f0127bde61de3fbe01def7d00f151c2fcca6d1c"
```
# Fix
---
* Do not rely to much on the information in the header as we know they can be altered
* And don't give flaws information in the commentary section (lol)
