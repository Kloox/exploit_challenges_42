At the start of the VM if you are like us on VMWare Workstation spam "shift". ("ctrl + alt + F1" on VirtualBox)
It will start the boot loader which allows us to overwrite the kernel instruction.
Let's just pass as argument : live init=/bin/sh
It will run the ISO live.
It tells the kernel to run /bin/sh instead of the default start which is /sbin/init
It specifies the kernel to boot with the disk in read-write mode instead of read-only mode.
