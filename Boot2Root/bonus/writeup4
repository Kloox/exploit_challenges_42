Here what we find is a shortcut.
In the previous writeup we started on the forum which allows us to connect to the forum.
Which gave us the mail address to access the webmail server.
Then we could connect to phpmyadmin.
To finaly do a request to create a remote shell and walk through the filesystem.

We find a way to bypass all that and directly have the filesystem.
This allows us to have directly access of programs which are in home of laurie, thor and zaz.
Even the tarball fun where we can find the password for laurie.

To do that we directly mount the ISO with DiskImageMounter.
We explore the files and found BornToSec/casper/filesystem.squash

Let's unsquash the file.

unsquashfs -f -d boot2rootDir BornToSec/casper/filesystem.squash

We now have in our directory boot2rootDir all files of the VM.
The home of ft_root, laurie, laurie@borntosec.net, lmezard, LOOKATME, thor and zaz.

We can go to zaz and exploit it again to have root access with a simple buffer overflow as we did previously.
