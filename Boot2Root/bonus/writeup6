It's not very usefull but we can modify lmezard as admin of the forum and play a little bit with it.

After finding the access of phpmyadmin in the mails of laurie@borntosec.net we can modify the rights of lmezard.

We can modify the "user_type" of lmezard in the table "mlf2_userdata" and set it to "2" which is the code to be admin.

Go back to the forum log to lmezard with the usual password "!q\]Ej?*5K5cy*AJ", and it's done you are admin.

You have all the rights, have fun !
