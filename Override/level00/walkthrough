After runing the program we see it waits a password.

After disassemble the main function we can see that there is a call to system which open a shell

0x08048501 <+109>:   call   0x80483a0 <system@plt>

When we execute the program we see that a password is requiered.
Let's check if the password is hard written in the code

Indeed just after the scanf there is a cmp.

0x080484e7 <+83>:    cmp    $0x149c,%eax

0x149c = 5276

level00@OverRide:~$ ./level00
