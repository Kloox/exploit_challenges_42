# LEVEL00

We used the command ```find``` in order to find a file related to the user flag00 using the following command  ```find / -user flag00 2>/dev/null```.

We noticed that the following file **/usr/sbin/john** was related to flag00.

In this file, we found this token ```cdiiddwpgswtgt```. It was not the good password for ```su flag00```. We tried to reverse its encryption and found that with a **ROT11** it gives ```nottoohardhere```, which seems like a suitable password.
```
su flag00
Password: nottoohardhere
