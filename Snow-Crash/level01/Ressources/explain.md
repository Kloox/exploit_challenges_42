# LEVEL01

We can find the flag01 password in **/etc/passwd** but he is hashed.


``` 42hDRfypTqqnw ```

We can use John the ripper to bruteforce this password.

``` echo 42hDRfypTqqnw > mypass```

``` john mypass --show ```

```
?:abcdefg

1 password hash cracked, 0 left
```

Using the password ```abcdefg``` we are log in flag01

```
$> getflag
