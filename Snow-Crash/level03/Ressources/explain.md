# LEVEL03

In the **home** there is a binary file named **level03**.
```ls -l``` shows us a **setuid bit** which means when an executable is launched, it does not run with the privileges of the user who launched it, but with that of the file owner instead.

Here owner is **flag03**.

With the command ```strings``` we can see this line ```/usr/bin/env echo Exploit Me```.

Here to find ``echo`` the binary is using the path of ``env``.

We just need to modify the ```env``` like this :

```export PATH=/tmp:$PATH```

This will mean that the binary will look for the **echo** command in the directory ```/tmp``` first. So we just put in ```/tmp``` the **getflag** binary renamed **echo**  

Run ```$> ./level03``` and get ```qi0maab88jeaj46qoumi7maus```
