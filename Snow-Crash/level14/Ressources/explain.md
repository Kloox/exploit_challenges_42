# LEVEL14

After an extended deep search, we didn't found anything related to flag14 nor level14.

So, we decide to reverse getflag to obtain the flag14.

Obviously, the debugging symbols are removed, but we can always disassemble the main function.

We were able to identify the instructions that print the flags.

Flag14 is print in instruction +1183 (0x08048de5)

```

gdb /bin/getflag

# Set a breakpoint in main
b main

# Run the exec
run

# Jump directly to 0x08048de5
ju *0x08048de5
Continuing at 0x8048de5.

We obtain the flag : **7QiHafiNa3HVozsaXkawuYrTstxbpABHD8CPnHJ**

```
level14@SnowCrash:~$ su flag14
