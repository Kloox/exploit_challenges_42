# LEVEL05

When we connect on level05 we have a notification ```You have new mail.```.
The mail tells us there is a cron task running every 2 minutes. This job will executes ```/usr/sbin/openarenaserver``` which is a script that executes everything in the directory **/opt/openarenaserver** and delete each one.

We inject the following script:
```/rofs/bin/getflag > /tmp/flag```

After waiting the execution we find our **/tmp/flag** file filled with : 
```viuaaale9huek52boumoomioc```
