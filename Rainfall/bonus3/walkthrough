After reversing we see an execl("/bin/sh", "sh"). To access it, we need to verify the condition : if (strcmp(data, str) != 0) .

We can see that the var str contains argv[1].
We can see that the var data contains the output of fread.

(data = esp + 0x18)

It set data[atoi(str)] at 0 .

So if we put a 0 in str, we can set data[0] to "\0", but the strcmp condition will not pass because it will compare the ascii value of the char '0' which is 48.
Where '\0' is 0 on the ascii table.
But if we set "" as argv[1] atoi will return 0 and the strcmp condition will pass and open the shell. (compare '\0' with '\0')
