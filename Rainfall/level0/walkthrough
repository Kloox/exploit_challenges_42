Here when we execute the program it segfault.

level0@RainFall:~$ ./level0
Segmentation fault (core dumped)


We try to pass a random parameter :

level0@RainFall:~$ ./level0 42
No !

We believe it waits for a specific entry. Let's disas the main.

We see can see a cmp :

   0x08048ed9 <+25>:    cmp    $0x1a7,%eax

compare args with the value $0x1a7 which is in decimal 423.

We can also see that there is a call to execv which opens a shell.

   0x08048f51 <+145>:   call   0x8054640 <execv>


level0@RainFall:~$ ./level0 423
$ cat /home/user/level1/.pass
